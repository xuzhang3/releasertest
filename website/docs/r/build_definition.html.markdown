## Example Usage

### Tfs
```hcl
resource "azuredevops_project" "project" {
  name       = "Sample Project"
  visibility         = "private"
  version_control    = "Git"
  work_item_template = "Agile"
}

resource "azuredevops_git_repository" "repository" {
  project_id = azuredevops_project.project.id
  name       = "Sample Repository"
  initialization {
    init_type = "Clean"
  }
}

resource "azuredevops_variable_group" "vars" {
  project_id   = azuredevops_project.project.id
  name         = "Infrastructure Pipeline Variables"
  description  = "Managed by Terraform"
  allow_access = true

  variable {
    name  = "FOO"
    value = "BAR"
  }
}

resource "azuredevops_build_definition" "build" {
  project_id = azuredevops_project.project.id
  name       = "Sample Build Definition"
  path       = "\\ExampleFolder"

  ci_trigger {
    use_yaml = true
  }

  repository {
    repo_type   = "TfsGit"
    repo_id     = azuredevops_git_repository.repository.id
    branch_name = azuredevops_git_repository.repository.default_branch
    yml_path    = "azure-pipelines.yml"
  }

  variable_groups = [
    azuredevops_variable_group.vars.id
  ]

  variable {
    name  = "PipelineVariable"
    value = "Go Microsoft!"
  }

  variable {
    name      = "PipelineSecret"
    secret_value     = "ZGV2cw"
    is_secret = true
  }
}
```

### GitHub Enterprise
```hcl
resource "azuredevops_build_definition" "sample_dotnetcore_app_release" {
  project_id = azuredevops_project.project.id
  name       = "Sample Build Definition"
  path       = "\\ExampleFolder"

  ci_trigger {
    use_yaml = true
  }

  repository {
    repo_type             = "GitHubEnterprise"
    repo_id               = "<GitHub Org>/<Repo Name>"
    github_enterprise_url = "https://github.company.com"
    branch_name           = "master"
    yml_path              = "azure-pipelines.yml"
    service_connection_id = "..."
  }

}
```

## Argument Reference

- `path` - (Optional) The folder path of the build definition.
- `agent_pool_name` - (Optional) The agent pool that should execute the build.
- `repository` - (Required) A `repository` block as documented below.
- `ci_trigger` - (Optional) Continuous Integration trigger.
- `pull_request_trigger` - (Optional) Pull Request Integration Integration trigger.
- `variable_groups` - (Optional) A list of variable group IDs (integers) to link to the build definition.
- `variable` - (Optional) A list of `variable` blocks, as documented below.

`variable` block supports the following:

- `name` - (Required) The name of the variable.
- `value` - (Optional) The value of the variable.
- `secret_value` - (Optional) The secret value of the variable. Used when `is_secret` set to `true`.
- `is_secret` - (Optional) True if the variable is a secret. Defaults to `false`.
