## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `project_id` - (Required) The ID of the project in which the policy will be created.
- `enabled` - (Optional) A flag indicating if the policy should be enabled. Defaults to `true`.
- `blocking` - (Optional) A flag indicating if the policy should be blocking. Defaults to `true`.
- `settings` - (Required) Configuration for the policy. This block must be defined exactly once.

A `settings` block supports the following:

- `submitter_can_vote` - (Optional) Controls whether or not the submitter's vote counts. Defaults to `false`.
