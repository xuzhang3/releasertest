# azuredevops_iteration_permissions

Manages permissions for an Iteration (Sprint)

~> **Note** Permissions can be assigned to group principals and not to single user principals.

## Permission levels

Permission for Iterations within Azure DevOps can be applied on two different levels.
Those levels are reflected by specifying (or omitting) values for the arguments `project_id` and `path`.

## Example Usage

```hcl

resource "azuredevops_project" "project" {
  name       = "Sample Project"
  work_item_template = "Agile"
  version_control    = "Git"
  visibility         = "private"
  description        = "Managed by Terraform"
}

data "azuredevops_group" "project-readers" {
	project_id = azuredevops_project.project.id
	name       = "Readers"
}

resource "azuredevops_iteration_permissions" "root-permissions" {
	project_id  = azuredevops_project.project.id
	principal   = azuredevops_group.project-readers.id
	permissions = {
	  CREATE_CHILDREN = "Deny"
	  GENERIC_READ    = "NotSet"
	  DELETE          = "Deny"
	}
}

resource "azuredevops_iteration_permissions" "iteration-permissions" {
	project_id  = azuredevops_project.project.id
	principal   = azuredevops_group.project-readers.id
	path        = "Iteration 1"
	permissions = {
	  CREATE_CHILDREN = "Allow"
	  GENERIC_READ    = "NotSet"
	  DELETE          = "Allow"
	}
}
```
