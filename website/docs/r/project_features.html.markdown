# azuredevops_project_features

Manages features for Azure DevOps projects

## Example Usage

```hcl
provider "azuredevops" {
  version = ">= 0.0.1"
}

data "azuredevops_project" "tf-project-test-001" {
  name = "Test Project"
}

resource "azuredevops_project_features" "my-project-features" {
  project_id = data.azuredevops_project.tf-project-test-001.id
  features = {
      "testplans" = "disabled"
      "artifacts" = "enabled"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `projectd_id` - (Required) The `id` of the project for which the project features will be managed.
- `features` - (Required) Defines the status (`enabled`, `disabled`) of the project features.  
   Valid features `boards`, `repositories`, `pipelines`, `testplans`, `artifacts`

> **NOTE:**  
> It's possible to define project features both within the [`azuredevops_project_features` resource](project_features.html) and
> via the `features` block by using the [`azuredevops_project` resource](project.html).
> However it's not possible to use both methods to manage group members, since there'll be conflicts.
