## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azuredevops_project" "project" {
  name       = "Sample Project"
  work_item_template = "Agile"
  version_control    = "Git"
  visibility         = "private"
  description        = "Managed by Terraform"
}

data "azuredevops_iteration" "root-iteration" {
	project_id = azuredevops_project.project.id
	path = "/"
	fetch_children = true
}

data "azuredevops_iteration" "child-iteration" {
	project_id = azuredevops_project.project.id
	path = "/Iteration 1"
	fetch_children = true
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `project_id` - (Required) The project ID.
- `path` - (Optional) The path to the Iteration, _Format_: URL relative; if omitted, or value `"/"` is used, the root Iteration will be returned
