  principal_name = "contoso-user@contoso.onmicrosoft.com"
}

# Load all users know inside an organization
data "azuredevops_users" "all-users" {
}

# Load all users know inside an organization originating from a specific source (origin)
data "azuredevops_users" "all-from-origin" {
  origin = "aad"
}

# Load all users know inside an organization filtered by their subject types
data "azuredevops_users" "all-from-subject_types" {
  subject_types = [ "aad", "msa" ]
}

# Load a single user by origin and origin ID
data "azuredevops_users" "all-from-origin-id" {
  origin = "aad"
  origin_id = "a7ead982-8438-4cd2-b9e3-c3aa51a7b675"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `principal_name` - (Optional) The PrincipalName of this graph member from the source provider.
- `subject_types` - (Optional) A list of user subject subtypes to reduce the retrieved results, e.g. `msa`, `aad`, `svc` (service identity), `imp` (imported identity), etc. The supported subject types are listed below.
- `origin` - (Optional) The type of source provider for the `origin_id` parameter (ex:AD, AAD, MSA) The supported origins are listed below.
- `origin_id` - (Optional) The unique identifier from the system of origin.

DataSource without specifying any arguments will return all users inside an organization.

List of possible subject types

```hcl
AadUser                 = "aad"    # Azure Active Directory Tenant
MsaUser                 = "msa"    # Windows Live
UnknownUser             = "unusr"
BindPendingUser         = "bnd"    # Invited user with pending redeem status
WindowsIdentity         = "win"    # Windows Active Directory user
UnauthenticatedIdentity = "uauth"
ServiceIdentity         = "svc"
AggregateIdentity       = "agg"
ImportedIdentity        = "imp"
ServerTestIdentity      = "tst"
GroupScopeType          = "scp"
CspPartnerIdentity      = "csp"
SystemServicePrincipal  = "s2s"
SystemLicense           = "slic"
SystemScope             = "sscp"
SystemCspPartner        = "scsp"
SystemPublicAccess      = "spa"
SystemAccessControl     = "sace"
AcsServiceIdentity      = "acs"
Unknown                 = "ukn"
```

List of possible origins

```hcl
ActiveDirectory          = "ad"   # Windows Active Directory
AzureActiveDirectory     = "aad"  # Azure Active Directory
MicrosoftAccount         = "msa"  # Windows Live Account
VisualStudioTeamServices = "vsts" # DevOps
GitHubDirectory          = "ghb"  # GitHub
```

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

- `users` - A list of existing users in your Azure DevOps Organization with details about every single user which includes:

  - `descriptor` - The descriptor is the primary way to reference the graph subject while the system is running. This field will uniquely identify the same graph subject across both Accounts and Organizations.
  - `principal_name` - This is the PrincipalName of this graph member from the source provider. The source provider may change this field over time and it is not guaranteed to be immutable for the life of the graph member by VSTS.
  - `origin` - The type of source provider for the origin identifier (ex:AD, AAD, MSA)
  - `origin_id` - The unique identifier from the system of origin. Typically a sid, object id or Guid. Linking and unlinking operations can cause this value to change for a user because the user is not backed by a different provider and has a different unique id in the new provider.
  - `display_name` - This is the non-unique display name of the graph subject. To change this field, you must alter its value in the source provider.
  - `mail_address` - The email address of record for a given graph member. This may be different than the principal name.
